TODO_List
=========

A simple todo list server using flask_admin.
-----
 All you have to install is flask_sqlalchemy and flask_admin. Yes, it's so simple but work well.
 To make it work, you should have Python installed in your system and then do as follows:
* `git clone https://github.com/jhgdike/TODO_List`
* `virtualenv venv` if you use Python2.7+ or `pyvenv venv` if you use Python3
* `. venv/bin/activate`
* `pip install flask-admin`
* `pip install flask-sqlalchemy`
* `python app.py runserver`

 Then you can request the server by input `localhost:8000` to your browser to visit the TODO list.
